					<h2>What is React</h2>
					<p class="fragment" style="color: #fff"> React â€“ an open source JavaScript library for building user
						interfaces.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="color: #fff"> React can be used to develop single page and mobile apps.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="color: #fff">Its goal is to provide high speed, simplicity and scalability. As a
						library for developing user interfaces, React is often used with other libraries such as MobX, Redux, and
						GraphQL.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p style="color: #fff">React is the most popular javascript framework among all the rest. This is evidenced by
						statistics on the frequency of use of a particular framework by developers throughout the year.</p>

					<h2 style="color: #fff">History of developing</h2>
					<p style="color: #fff" class="fragment">In 2011, Jordan Wolk, inspired by the results of XHP, creates the
						React prototype, FaxJs. But FaxJs remained just an experimental project and in 2012 Jordan Wolk was already
						working on a React prototype.</p>
					<p style="color: #fff" class="fragment">It is worth noting that the idea of creating what would later be
						called React arose when the Facebook Ads team faced serious problems associated with both writing and
						understanding code on projects, and managing the state of the application. </p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="#6495ED">
					<p style="color: #fff">In those days, it was popular to manage the state of the application thanks to
						mutations, as a result, with the growth of the project, it became more and more difficult to understand
						which action or event and at what point caused certain changes in the application.</p>
					<p style="color: #fff" class="fragment">Application behavior became unpredictable. Also, any change on the
						page, even a minor one, often provoked a re-rendering of the entire application. Then the idea arose to
						create such a tool that would take advantage of an immutable approach to data management and allow you to
						write code in a declarative style.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="#6495ED">
					<p style="color: #fff">At first, the public regarded React with distrust, and some thought it was a big step
						back</p>
					<p style="color: #fff" class="fragment">But with the support of Facebook, Netflix, Airbnb and the release of
						React Native, as well as ease of learning and continuous improvement, React quickly gained public confidence
						and became the most popular front-end library in 2016.</p>
					<p style="color: #fff" class="fragment">Now React does not stop in its development and continues to work on
						improving performance, experience of interaction of programmers with the library and to this day remains the
						most popular front-end library and one of the best options for cross-platform projects.</p>

					<h2>Main features of the react</h2>
					<p style="color: #bdc2c1" class="fragment">Unidirectional data transfer</p>
					<p style="color: #bdc2c1" class="fragment">Properties are passed from parent to child components. Components
						receive properties as a set of immutable values, so a component cannot directly modify properties, but can
						invoke changes through callback functions. This mechanism is called "properties down, events up".</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p style="color: #bdc2c1">Virtual DOM</p>
					<p style="color: #bdc2c1">React uses virtual DOM. React creates an in-memory cache structure that allows you
						to calculate the difference between the previous and current state of the interface to optimally update the
						browser's DOM. Thus, the programmer can work with the page, assuming that it is being updated as a whole,
						but the library itself decides which page components need to be updated.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p style="color: #bdc2c1">JSX</p>
					<p style="color: #bdc2c1">JavaScript XML (JSX) is a JavaScript syntax extension that allows you to use
						HTML-like syntax to describe the structure of an interface. Typically, components are written using JSX, but
						there is also the option of using regular JavaScript.</p>

					<h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of React</h2>
					<ul>
						Advantages:
						<li class="fragment">Based on simple programming languages.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Extreme flexibility of the application.</li>
						<li class="fragment">The application can withstand heavy loads.</li>
						<li class="fragment">React and SEO interact well</li>
						<li class="fragment">Ensures the immutability of parental data.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Has an open data library.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Low weight of the database</li>
						<li class="fragment">Hybrid mobile applications in React look almost identical to native ones</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						Disadvantages:
						<li class="fragment">Disordered documentation.</li>
						<li class="fragment">The large selection of tools is baffling.</li>
						<li class="fragment">It takes a long time to master all the nuances.</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>In conclusion, I want to say that React is a very good technology with great potential, and thanks to its many advantages, it is the most popular framework that continues to evolve and improve itself.</p>
